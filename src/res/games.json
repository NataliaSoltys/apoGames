The plot focuses on 4 playable survivors trying to survive and escape off the fictional island of Banoi. The game was announced at the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo,[4] but delayed until 2011. The game's cinematic announcement trailer was met with controversy over its depiction of a dead child. However reception was nonetheless positive, with praise going towards the emotional impact, animation, and story, with the trailer being held as one of the best in any medium. The game was released in 2011. September for North America/Europe and in October for Japan. Despite the pre-release acclaim, the game received generally lukewarm reviews. While praised for its atmosphere, gameplay and playable characters, it was also criticized for large technical difficulties and in-game glitches, graphics, and most notably being hampered for lacking the emotional themes presented in the trailer. A stand-alone DLC expansion, Dead Island: Riptide was released in 2013. The spin-off, Escape Dead Island was released on 18 November 2014. And a sequel, Dead Island 2 was set to be released in 2017, but has been delayed indefinitely.[5] A remastered version of the game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on 31 May 2016. Under the title Dead Island: Definitive Collection; it bundles the game with Riptide, all DLC, and a 16-bit side-scrolling game called Dead Island: Retro Revenge.",

The games have been released to personal computers, game consoles, and mobile devices and have had both digital and physical releases. The series, like the comic, starts with an epidemic that turns the dead into zombie-like walkers that decimates civilization, and takes place along the United States eastern seaboard. The series focuses on the character of Clementine, a young girl that is cared for by Lee Everett during the first season, and subsequently travels both by herself and with other groups in later seasons after Lee sacrifices himself for her. During the second season, she becomes the adoptive caretaker of AJ, an infant left parentless. When Clementine later joins with a survival group called the New Frontier in the third season, they strip AJ from her, and Clementine works with another survivor, Javier Garcia, to rescue both their families from the New Frontier. During the final season, some years later, Clementine and AJ join other teenagers holding out at their boarding school to protect it from bandits and walkers. Some of the characters from the comic series, such as Shawn Greene, Glenn Rhee, Hershel Greene, Michonne, Siddiq and Paul Jesus Monroe, have appeared during the video game series.",

Capcom announced the Resident Evil 2 remake in August 2015 and released the first trailer and gameplay footage at E3 2018. Resident Evil 2 received critical acclaim, with praise for its presentation, gameplay, and faithfulness to the original and was nominated for several awards, including for game of the year. As of 2021, the game had sold over eight million copies, outselling the original.[1]",

Released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, it is a remake of the 1999 game Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. The game follows former elite agent Jill Valentine and mercenary Carlos Oliveira as they attempt to find a vaccine and escape from a city during a viral outbreak. The game is played from an over-the-shoulder, third-person perspective and requires the player to solve puzzles and defeat a variety of monsters while being pursued by a creature called Nemesis. Most of Resident Evil 3 was developed concurrently with the 2019 remake of Resident Evil 2 and both games run on Capcom's proprietary RE Engine. Although the game features the same premise as the original, many parts were rearranged in favor of a more focused story. To honor the more action-oriented approach of the original, developers revamped the movement speed and animations from the Resident Evil 2 remake and added an ability for players to dodge incoming attacks. Because some features from the original game were excluded, a separate online multiplayer game, Resident Evil: Resistance, was bundled with Resident Evil 3. Resident Evil 3 received generally favorable reviews from critics, who highlighted its compelling narrative, tense atmosphere, and graphics. Criticism was primarily targeted at the game's short length and missing features from the original. The game's larger emphasis on moment-to-moment action and scripted sequences also disappointed some critics. According to Capcom, the game had sold 4.6 million copies by November 2021.",

The story is based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's novel of the same name, where survivors of a nuclear war have taken refuge in the Metro tunnels of Moscow. Players control Artyom, a man who must save his home station from the dangers lurking within the Metro. In the game, players encounter human and mutant enemies, who can be killed with a variety of firearms. Players must also wear a gas mask to explore areas covered in fallout radiation, both underground and on the surface. Metro 2033 was the debut title for 4A Games, whose founders had experience working on S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl at GSC Game World. Glukhovsky chose 4A to adapt his novel due to the studio's location in Eastern Europe, and their expertise in developing first-person shooters. Glukhovsky gave the studio a lot of creative freedom. 4A focused their efforts on storytelling and atmosphere, intentionally avoiding any multiplayer gameplay to achieve their goal. The game was powered by the studio's own proprietary 4A Engine. It was first announced in 2006 as Metro 2033: The Last Refuge. The game was released in March 2010 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360. Critics gave the game positive reviews, with praise for its horror elements, detailed environments, and interesting plot. However, the game was also criticized for its bugs and artificial intelligence. Metro 2033 was profitable for THQ, selling more than 1.5 million copies by June 2012, though the publisher felt that their marketing efforts were rushed. The sequel Metro: Last Light was released in 2013, with Deep Silver acquiring the publishing rights from THQ after their bankruptcy. A compilation of both titles was released in 2014 as Metro Redux for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. A third instalment, Metro Exodus, was released in 2019.",

            "description":"Dying Light 2 Stay Human is an action role-playing survival horror video game, featuring a zombie apocalyptic-themed open world. Set 15 years after Dying Light, it stars a new protagonist named Aiden Caldwell (voiced by Jonah Scott), who is equipped with various parkour skills. Players can perform actions such as climbing ledges, sliding, leaping off from edges, and wall running to quickly navigate the city. It was confirmed that there are over 3000 parkour animations to give a more fluid free running experience. Tools such as a grappling hook and a paraglider also aid traversal in the city. Aiden can also use the undead to break his fall. The game is mostly melee-based with the majority of fighting using melee weapons. The melee weapons have a limited lifespan and will degrade as the player uses them in combat.[2] Long-range weapons such as crossbows, shotguns, and spears can be used as well. Weapons can be upgraded with different blueprints and components which can be found by breaking down weapons for craft parts. Aiden can also utilize superhuman skills due to the infection.[3] New zombies have been added. Like the first game, the zombies are slow when exposed to sunlight, but they become more aggressive and hostile at night. The game is set in the city of Villedor, a massive urban open world set in Europe that players can explore freely.[5] The map, which is four times bigger than the original game, is broken into seven distinct regions and each has its own landmarks and locations. When exploring the city, players can scavenge different scraps and resources for crafting new items and weapons.[6] In the game, players meet different factions and settlements and have to make different decisions that would fundamentally change the state of the game's world and how non-playable characters view Aiden. The consequences are far-reaching, with the player being able to bring prosperity to a faction while completely destroying another settlement. Making certain decisions will open up or seal-off areas in the city, encouraging players to complete multiple playthroughs.[7] Like its predecessor, the game features four-player cooperative multiplayer.[8]",

The development of the game was ambitious; it was stated that the game would feature an all-new multiplatform engine, made from scratch to fit S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2. During development, numerous layoffs and overall attrition through the development of the game had shrunk GSC's employee count by 75%. Two years in, Grigorovich had announced the immediate cessation of all development due to personal reasons, likely as a result of financial difficulty.[5] GSC Game World was officially dissolved on December 9, 2011.[6] The official Twitter account posted We will do our best to continue. However, at this moment, nothing is certain. After several months of uncertainty,[8] an update was posted that the development would continue after the holidays, although it would require funding.[9] However, the cancellation of this build of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 had been formally announced in April 2012 on the company's Facebook page, officially stated to have resulted from dispute between investors, staff, and the original IP rights owner.",

In the game, players control Max Rockatansky as he progresses through the wasteland building a vehicle, the Magnum Opus, to do battle with a gang of raiders, led by Scabrous Scrotus, and to reach the storied Plains of Silence, where he hopes to find peace. Mad Max emphasizes vehicular combat, in which players can use weapon and armor upgrades on their car to fight enemies. It is set in an open post-apocalyptic wasteland consisting of deserts, canyons, and caves. Two other Mad Max games, developed by Cory Barlog and Interplay Entertainment respectively, were in production before the announcement of this game, but neither of them were successfully released. Although Mad Max is not based on the film series, it was inspired by its universe, and franchise creator George Miller was consulted during the game's pre-production. Avalanche Studios found developing a vehicular-combat video game a challenge because of their inexperience with creating that type of game. Announced at E3 2013, the game was re-tooled during development and the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were canceled. Originally planned for release in 2014, it was released in September the following year, several months after the theatrical release of Mad Max: Fury Road, the fourth film in the series. Mad Max received overall mixed reviews from critics. Although the game's environment, direction, vehicular combat, and graphics were praised, its quest design and story were criticized. The game became the eighth best-selling retail game in the United States in September 2015.",
